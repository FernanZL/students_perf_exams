# Data analysis and statistical testing for students performances in exams.

This project consists of a statistical analysis of the perfomance of students on exams, based on a Kaggle dataset. You can download the data from its Kaggle [page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams).


## Included Files

- 'st_perf_exams.ipynb': notebook containing the analysis.

## Requirements

To run the project, Python 3.10 and the following libraries are required:  
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib  
- tabulate
- itertools
- scipy
- jupyter    

To install the dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas jupyter seaborn matplotlib tabulate itertools scipy  
```

## Download the Dataset
Before running the project, download the dataset from Kaggle, using the link provided above and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook ('st_perf_exams.ipynb').

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
If you don't have Git installed, first [install](https://git-scm.com/) it, then run this command in your terminal to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FernanZL/students_perf_exams.git
```

2. Install the dependencies
Once you have cloned the repository, install the necessary libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas jupyter seaborn matplotlib tabulate itertools scipy
```

3. Open the notebook
To open the notebook in Jupyter, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook st_perf_exams.ipynb
```

Within the Jupyter notebook, you can run the code cells one by one by pressing Shift + Enter to perform the analysis and get the results.
